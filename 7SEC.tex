\chapter{SEC of Pipelined Implementation with RTL}
\label{sec:SEC}

{textbf {Talk to Proff Fei regarding this. We have tested 3 examples which are currently running in Kecheng's algorithm and SEC testing is broken.}

We have tested the pipeline reference model generated by our certified algorithm with the pipelined RTL generated by a behavioral synthesis tool using SEC for a variety of pipelined designs across different domains - TEA,XTEA and PIPELOOP. The test designs are non-trivial to pipeline and require data forwarding and use of temporary shadow registers to remove data hazards. 
%Our test cases include memory operation designs, cryptography designs and designs for data, signal and image processing with varied pipeline intervals and depths.
