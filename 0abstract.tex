Behavioral Synthesis is the process of compiling an Electronic System Level (ESL) design in
high-level languages such as C, C++ or SystemC into Register-Transfer Level (RTL) implementation
in hardware description languages such as Verilog or VHDL.
Loop pipelining is a critical transformation in this process, which improves
the throughput and reduces the latency of the synthesized hardware. It is
complex and error-prone, and a small bug can result in faulty hardware with expensive
ramifications. Therefore, it is critical to certify the loop pipelining transformation
so that designers can trust the behavioral synthesis process.
Certifying a loop pipelining transformation is however, a major research challenge
because there is a huge semantic gap between the input sequential design and the output
pipelined implementation, making it infeasible to verify their equivalence with automated sequential equivalence
checking (SEC) techniques.

Certification of a loop pipelining transformation is possible by a combination of theorem
proving and SEC: (1) creating a certified pipelining algorithm which generates a reference
pipeline model by exploiting pipeline generation information from the synthesis flow ({\em e.g.},
the iteration interval of a generated pipeline) and (2) conduct SEC between the synthesized pipeline
and this reference model. A key and arguably, the most complex component of this
approach is development of the certified
loop pipelining algorithm. We propose a framework of certified pipelining primitives which we show
are essential for designing pipelining algorithms. Using our framework, we build
a certified loop pipelining algorithm. We also propose a key invariant in certifying this algorithm, which links sequential loops
with their pipelined counterparts. This is unlike other invariants that have been used in pipeline proofs.

The result of this dissertation is a framework for creating certified pipelining algorithms
utilizing a mechanical theorem prover. Using this framework, we have developed a certified loop pipelining
algorithm. This certified algorithm is essential in the overall approach to certify
behaviorally synthesized pipelined designs. We test the scalability and robustness of our algorithm on
industrial-strength ESL designs that result in tens of thousands of lines of RTL implementations.
