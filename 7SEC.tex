\section{Inside Experiments}
{\bf Note to Disha: Look at Kecheng's thesis and include all the designs he has tested his algorithm for if possible. To discuss with kecheng further}  

We plan to test the pipeline reference model generated by our tool with the pipelined RTL generated by a behavioral synthesis tool using SEC for a variety of pipelined designs across different domains. Our test cases include memory operation designs, cryptography designs and designs for data, signal and image processing with varied pipeline intervals and depths. The test designs are non-trivial to pipeline and require data forwarding and use of temporary shadow registers to remove data hazards.
